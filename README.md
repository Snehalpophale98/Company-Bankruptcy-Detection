# Company-Bankruptcy-Detection
#Introduction
Company Bankruptcy ðŸ“‰ðŸ’¸


Data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999â€“2009 representing company bankruptcy based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

In this repository we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether we can correctly predict which comapnies will face bankrptcy in the future. As described in the data section, the dataset contains:

95 features (X1-X95, business regulations of Taiwan Stock Exchange)

1 Vector of labels

Our aim in this project is to use these features to understand their impact/role on the selected models and how they can help us recognizing the companies that are close to bankrupcty.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

In the EDA part, analyzed every feature using histogram, checked the correlation of every feature with each other. Checked the correlation among the numeric columns. 
Also correlation of categpric columns with Target columns.Correlation of numeric columns with target columns. Studied their heatmap.
